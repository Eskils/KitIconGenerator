## Project Organization

This application is written in Swift using SwiftUI for layout and SceneKit for rendering. 

The app is built cross-platform for iOS and macOS, and uses the `CrossPlatform` helper library to provide typealiases and extensions for common UI elements. Anything prefixed with `CP` originates from this library.

Implementation of rendering the scene can be found in the `KitIconRenderer` library.
